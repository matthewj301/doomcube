# Sensorless homing.
#
# Tune the sensorless_x_current variable and the SGTHRS/SGT value in this file untill you get reliable homing.
# Beware of false instant triggering which can make it look like the homing procedure is skipping an axis, when in fact it's not.
# This is especially true for the Y axis on CoreXY machines.
#
# Read the klipper documentation for more info: https://www.klipper3d.org/TMC_Drivers.html#sensorless-homing
#
# Note: if your board has diag jumpers, you would need to insert them for the specific drivers you want to use for sensorless homing on.
# Note: Sensorless homing does NOT work if you drivers have a missing DIAG pins.    
# Check https://www.klipper3d.org/TMC_Drivers.html#sensorless-homing for tuning instructions.
